### Idea #1: Pre-Interview Content Management System (2026-01-12)
**Category**: User Experience + AI & Content

**Description**:
Enable pre-interview content uploading and organization before recording starts.

**Key Features**:
- **Pre-Upload Hub**: Upload all videos, images, and documents before interview begins
- **AI Organization**: Ask AI to automatically categorize and organize uploaded content by topic/theme
- **Manual Organization**: Alternative option to manually organize content yourself
- **Interview Type Differentiation**: Different workflows for AI-conducted vs human-conducted interviews
- **Question Timeline**: Create a vertical running timeline showing:
  - List of prepared questions
  - Topics covered with checkboxes
  - Associated content linked to each topic
  - Click to share content at relevant moments
- **Smart Content Association**: Link specific files to specific questions/topics
- **One-Click Sharing**: Click checkbox or topic to automatically share associated content during recording

**Use Cases**:
- Planning educational content with multiple visual aids
- Structured interviews with pre-defined topics
- Presentation-heavy podcasts with slides/diagrams
- Training sessions with reference materials

**Technical Considerations**:
- Pre-upload storage and organization
- AI categorization using Gemini API
- Timeline UI component with drag-and-drop
- Content-to-topic association metadata
- Integration with existing content sharing system

**Priority**: Medium-High (significant UX improvement for planned content)
